# Susy Circuit Simulations

This folder contains Susy's core analog circuit designs for use with the [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) simulation software.

Practical prototypes of each circuit were built and tested. SPICE models are not completely accurate and should be used as guidelines only.
